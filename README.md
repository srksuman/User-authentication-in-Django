Overview
The Django authentication system handles both authentication and authorization.
Briefly, authentication verifies a user is who they claim to be, and authorization
determines what an authenticated user is allowed to do. Here the term authentication
is used to refer to both tasks.
## The auth system consists of:
* Users
* Permissions: Binary (yes/no) flags designating whether a user may perform a certain task.
* Groups: A generic way of applying labels and permissions to more than one user.
* A configurable password hashing system
* Forms and view tools for logging in users, or restricting content
* A pluggable backend system
<br>
The authentication system in Django aims to be very generic and doesnâ€™t provide some features commonly found in web authentication systems. Solutions for some of these common problems have been implemented in third-party packages:

* Password strength checking
* Throttling of login attempts
* Authentication against third-parties (OAuth, for example)
* Object-level permissions
